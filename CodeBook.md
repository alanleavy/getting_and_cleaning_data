# Getting and Cleaning Data - Peer Assessment Project  - Code Book

## Introduction
The output of this data celaning project consists of two tidy datasets: 
* **tidy_data_1.txt** 
* **tidy_data_2.txt** 

The components implementing the data cleaning process are described in the accompanying **README.md** file.

The following sections detail the two tidy datasets, documenting:
* the original data sources, 
* how those data sources were transformed and
* the content of the resulting datasets.

## tidy_data_1.txt
The specified requirements for this data set were:

1. To create a single data set merging the original training and the test sets.  
2. To include only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
3. To uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
4. To label the data set appropriately with descriptive variable names.

## tidy_data_2.txt  
This dataset is a further summarisation of  **tidy_data_1.txt**.  
The specified requirement was to create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
